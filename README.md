# Best Albums Generator
## About
This was my capstone project for Ada Developers Academy. As someone who grew up in the music blogging era, I've always loved sharing my personal Best Albums Of The Year lists online, but I never found an easy way to keep track of everything I liked. Best Albums Generator aims to solve that problem, through a fun game that uses your listening data to make graphics and a text list.
## How It Works
Enter your Last.fm username on the homescreen.  
![Gif of someone typing in the username inolvidable- and clicking submit](https://github.com/dainizzz/best-albums-generator/assets/85927389/c4b0cd28-3093-47da-bd48-77bcac10f825)

Your listening data will then be analyzed using Musicbrainz, and a list of your most-listened-to albums released in the past year will be created.  You then get to pick and choose between two albums at a time, until your final ranked list of top 10 albums is created.  
![Two bubbles side by side. In each bubble is an album cover, album title, and a select button. The gif shows the select button being clicked and new albums being displayed after the click.](https://github.com/dainizzz/best-albums-generator/assets/85927389/a852c615-8884-4238-8db0-94bcc5d3db7b)

After that, you can customize your graphic with three different styles and custom names, or simply copy a plain-text version of your list for use elsewhere.

On the right, there are options to modify the image, including changing the style, hiding or showing the username, and adding a custom name in place of the username. Below the options is a button that says download graphic. There is also a text box containing the list of top albums, with a copy text button below it. The gif shows the various image options, and then the download graphic button being clicked and the graphic being downloaded.](https://github.com/dainizzz/best-albums-generator/assets/85927389/dadff0e6-574e-4033-8562-5d7aac4ebbb9)
## Future Plans
* Provide recommendations for missed albums users might like
* Analyze listening data to show trends
* Options for no year and specific year
